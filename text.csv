Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet
Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly
normal, thank you very much. Mr. Dursley made
drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any
neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had twice
the usual amount of neck, which came in very
useful as she
spent so much of her time spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called
Dudley and in their
opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
Mrs Dursley had a sister called Lily Potter. She
and her husband James Potter had a son called
Harry Potter. They lived far from the Dursleys and
did not speak to them much. They did not get
along.
One day, a man appeared outside of
the Dursleys house. He was tall, thin, and very
old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard,
which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
He was wearing long robes,
a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-
heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles
and his nose was very long and crooked, as though
it had been broken at least twice. This man's name
was Albus Dumbledore.
